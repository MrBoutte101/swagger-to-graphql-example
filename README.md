# Swagger to Graphql Example

Full credit to [Roman Krivtsov](https://github.com/yarax) for creating [swagger-to-graphql](https://github.com/yarax/swagger-to-graphql). This is just a repo for illustrative purposes of how one might use the `swagger-to-graphql` tool for auto generating an `Executable GraphQL Schema` from a rest api with swagger docs.

* Additionally, this is for the purpose of getting a quick graphql version of a rest api to then play with in a `graphiql` sandbox, to understand how querying the api will work and getting a feel for what was autogenerated by the tool.
* If you're looking to generate a graphql schema and then have it dumped out into a `.graphql` file _which isn't run on this server_, so that you could take that `.graphql` schema file and drop it in your own custom GraphQL Server. This is what your looking for:

```
npm i -g swagger-to-graphql
swagger-to-graphql --swagger=/path/to/swagger_schema.json > ./types.graphql
```

## Getting Started

1.  Pull down this repo locally
2.  Run `yarn`
3.  Replace the `petstore.json` file in `src/server.js`, with the swagger doc `.json` file of the Rest api you want to convert into a GraphQL API.
4.  Replace the value of `GQLProxyBaseUrl` in `src/server.js` with the base url of the rest api your looking to wrap
5.  Run `yarn dev`, unless you've changed the port number the app's set to listen to, the playground will be avaible at _localhost:3009/graphql_

## Notes on working with graphiql playground

```
# Keyboard shortcuts:
#
#  Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button above)

```

A sample query for the petstore api:

```
{
  getPetById(petId: "3") {
    id
    name
    category {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Requirement

**This app should be ran with node 8 or higher**
